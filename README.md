# Rusty-SGP4
A Rust crate to parse and propagate Two-Line Element (TLE) sets using Simplified Perturbations Models (SGP4).

## Motivations
I am pursuing this project for two reasons
1. To learn to write Rust code
2. To dive into the theory surrounding SGP4

## TODOs
- Error handling
- Implement SGP4 equations
- Write a math spec
- Include a visualizer?

## Testing and Documentation
```bash
# To run the unit tests
cargo test

# To build the Rust Docs
cargo doc
```
